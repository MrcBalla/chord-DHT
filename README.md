# chord-DHT

this repository contains a simple implementation of the distributed hash table CHORD, the aim of the entire code is the 
check of some theorical results about time complexity of DHT chord as described in the paper written by Ion Stoica, Robert Morris, David Karger, Frans Kaashoek, and Hari Balakrishnan.
All the comments in code are in italian, sorry for this :)
